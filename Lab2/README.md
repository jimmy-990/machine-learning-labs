# Lab 2: Identifying ML Problems, Selecting Open Datasets, and Methodology

## Dataset Summary
- Dataset name: Car Price Prediction Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Format: CSV (Tabular data)

This dataset contains automobile data collected to predict car prices based on various vehicle features. Each row represents a single car, while each column describes a specific characteristic such as brand, model, year, engine specifications, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and overall condition.

## Defining the Machine Learning Problem

This is a regression problem because the target variable (car price) is a continuous numerical value.

The target variable in this dataset is:
- Price

The goal of this model is to predict the price of a car based on its features, such as brand, model, year, engine details, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.
